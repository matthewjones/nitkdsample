## North Indy Taekwondo Club
The North Indy Taekwondo Club was founded on May 29, 1979 by Grandmaster Duncan Williams when he was a 2nd Dan Black Belt in the Chung Do Kwan style of Taekwondo.  Grandmaster Williams is presently a 7th Dan Black Belt with over forty years experience in the Korean martial arts of taekwondo and hapkido.

North Indy was founded on the belief that martial arts training should be fun as well as disciplined and structured.  Hence the club like atmosphere of our schools.  Make no mistake though, our students are well-disciplined individuals who are serious about their training.  Over the past thirty-five years our schools have earned the respect of martial arts communities across the country, and our students have achieved many state and national titles, including twenty-seven AAU National Champions since 2010.

Much of our success is due to the excellence of our instructors.  Our Chief Instructor, Grandmaster Williams, supervises the instruction at all of our school locations.  He is assisted by senior black belt instructors who add to the quality of our programs.  Grandmaster Williams was a respected tournament competitor for over fifteen years, and many of our assistant instructors have also competed at both state and national levels.  They have won several championships over the years and North Indy students benefit from their tournament experience.

The North Indy Taekwondo Club, in partnership with the YMCA's of Greater Indianapolis, holds classes at four locations.  Classes range from Totkwondo (ages 3-5), Youth Taekwondo (ages 6-12), to Adult Taekwondo (ages 13 and up) and focuses instruction at beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

## Founder and Chief Instructor
Grandmaster Duncan Williams is the founder and Chief Instructor of the North Indy Taekwondo Club of Indianapolis, Indiana with over forty years experience in the Korean martial arts of Taekwondo and hapkido.  He is certified by the World Taekwondo Federation, the World Martial Arts Federation, and the National Taekwondo Federation.  He is one of the founding members of the Indiana State Taekwondo Association, Inc. and served three terms as the association's Vice President.

Grandmaster Williams has trained and/or competed in thirty seven states and six foreign countries and was one of the state's top competitors in local and national tournaments for fifteen years.  He is an International Referee certified by both the United States and the Pan American Taekwondo Unions.

 
In 1982, Grandmaster Williams developed a self-defense program geared toward individuals not interested in pursuing formal martial arts instruction.  His program is well received by businesses, colleges, hospitals, and other institutions throughout Indiana and much of the mid-west.  He has become well known for his knowledge, expertise, and practical approach to the area of self-defense and has assisted with self-defense instruction at the Indiana State Law Enforcement Academy.

For thirty years Grandmaster Williams was an educator with the Metropolitan School District of Washington Township in Indianapolis, and uses this teaching expertise in his martial arts instruction.  In the fall of 1984, he entered into an agreement between North Indy Taekwondo Club and the YMCA's of Greater Indianapolis.  Over the past thirty-five years his programs have expanded and classes are now offered at five YMCA facilities.  He looks forward to the continued growth and expansion of his programs in the future.


During the summer of 2005, Grandmaster Williams traveled to South Korea with two other Indiana masters and a group of fifteen black belt students.  On July 6th, at the Wol Jeong Sa Buddhist Temple, he was promoted to 7th Dan.  In April of 2010 his title was elevated to Grandmaster.
