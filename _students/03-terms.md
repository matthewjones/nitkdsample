I will observe the principles of Taekwondo. 


I will respect the instructor and all senior students. 


I will respect all junior students and be a good role model. 


I will never misuse my Taekwondo skills or training. 


I will be a champion of freedom and justice. 


I will help build a more peaceful world.
