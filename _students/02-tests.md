Promotion tests are very important events. They are symbolic of graduation from one level of learning to the next higher level. Therefore, they are very serious and formal. Your best attitude, manners, and discipline are equally as important as your physical performance. 


When your time comes to test and your name is called, answer yes, Sir or yes, Ma'am as quickly as you can and speak in a loud clear voice. Run immediately to the location on the floor indicated by the test coordinator. Stand in ready position (Choon Bee) until instructed to bow. 


The first requirement of your test is the successful completion of the appropriate forms. You will perform your previous form, then your current level form with proper balance and execution of each technique. Since your test group will be performing the same forms, the group should move through the forms with the same timing and finish together. (Remember, you can always be asked to perform any or all of your previous forms.) 


At the conclusion of the forms, you will be instructed to face a partner and begin your appropriate "one-step self-defense" techniques, the second phase of your test. After bowing and checking your distance, alternate with your partner and demonstrate your current techniques as well as any of your previous techniques. When signaled to stop, bow to your partner. 


Your group will next be instructed to line up along on the end of the floor area to demonstrate your required kick combinations as well as kicks in isolation. Remember to kick with proper form and balance. 


At the conclusion of the kick combinations you will prepare for "free sparring" by getting all of the necessary safety equipment on. Free sparring will consist of a single two minute round against a single opponent. During this time you should demonstrate your fighting skills and techniques. 


The final phase of the test is "board breaking". Return to your original location on the floor and prepare the holder and board for your appropriate technique. Demonstrate your breaking technique with proper form, balance, and speed. When finished, bow to the judges' table and remain standing while your scores are recorded. 


Your group will be dismissed and taken to another room where you will answer questions on taekwondo vocabulary, techniques, and history. This can be either an oral or written exam. As you complete this portion of the test, you will be asked to return to the main examination room. 


At this time your group will be called back to the floor where you will be presented with the results of your examination and awarded your new rank. When your name is called, say yes, Sir or yes, Ma'am loudly and hurry forward to the judge who called you. Bow immediately and stand at attention in front of the judge. Accept your rewards and shake hands properly with your judge. Bow once more and return to your original floor position and wait until your group is dismissed. Bow, say thank you in Korean "Cam sa ham neda.", and leave the floor. 


How well you perform on the test is up to you. Be sure that you feel that you have earned your new rank, and that you have put forth your best effort. It is important for each student to be satisfied with his/her own performance. 



**The North Indy Belt Stripe System for promotion test eligibility**


During the period of training between promotion tests, students will have the opportunity to earn six colored stripes. These stripes are the requirements of eligibility for promotion to the next level of training. Each stripe indicates mastery of one of the components necessary for advancement. Below is an explanation of each colored stripe. 


<table>
	<tr><th colspan="2">Stripe</th><td><strong>Mastery required</strong></td></tr>
	<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>White</td><td>mastery of all current stances</td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="yellow">&nbsp;</td><td>Yellow</td><td>mastery of all current level Formalities</td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="green">&nbsp;</td><td>Green</td><td>mastery of all current self-defense techniques</td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="blue">&nbsp;</td><td>Blue</td><td>mastery of all current kicks</td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="red">&nbsp;</td><td>Red</td><td>mastery of all current blocks and punches</td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td>Black</td><td>proper attitude and effort shown in class</td></tr>
</table>


Stripes are presented during class to the individual student at the time they are earned. Students have approximately three months to earn the six stripes.
