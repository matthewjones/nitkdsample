## The Flag Of The United States Of America		
The basic flag of the United States is one of the oldest in the world. Every color and marking on the flag has meaning. The thirteen stripes represent the original thirteen colonies of our country. The fifty stars stand for the fifty individual states. Each of the colors was selected for their symbolic meaning. The red stands for "courage" and the blood that was shed for our freedom; the white stands for "purity" and the innocence of our new nation; and the blue stands for "loyalty" and the justice of our constitution. 


The flag does not have an official name, however, the unofficial name most used is "Stars and Stripes". Other names used to identify our flag are "Old Glory", from William Denver in 1824, and the "Star Spangled Banner", from Francis Scott Key in 1814. 


There is a proper way to display the U.S. flag. First, the blue area, known as the union or constellation, is always displayed in the upper left hand corner. The only exception to this is when the flag is worn on the right sleeve of a uniform, the union is on the right, leading the stripes. Whenever our flag is displayed with flags of other nations, the U.S. flag is always placed in a higher position than the others. If it is displayed with only one other flag, then the U.S. flag is always placed on the left. 


## The South Korean National Flag	
The South Korean National Flag, known as Tae Geuk, is a composite of oriental symbolism. It consists of a white background on which is found a circle, equally divided and perfectly balanced. 


The red upper portion of the circle is known as Yang, and the blue lower portion as Um. This ancient Um Yang represents the unity and the totality of the universe with its ever present equal opposites (hot and cold, light and dark, active and calm, man and woman, and so forth). 


The black bars found at the corners of the flag continue the symbolism. The three solid bars, located in the upper left corner, represent Heaven; the three broken bars in the lower right represent Earth. The two solid outer bars with the broken bar in between, located in the lower left corner, represent Fire; the two broken outer bars with the solid bar in between, located in the upper right corner, represent Water. 


The balance of the equal opposites found in the symbolism of the flag is as meaningful to the martial artist as it is reflective of the balance that he strives for as an ideal in his art and in his life.
