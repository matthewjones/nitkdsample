Tae Kyon, the ancient name for Taekwondo, is as old as the history of the Hwarang Do (an ancient military school), and dates back some 1,300 years.


Originally, Silla possessed the smallest territory when ancient Korea was divided into three kingdoms. She had to contend with constant invasions by the two larger kingdoms, Koguryo to the north and Baekchae to the west.


From the time of 500 A.D. Koguryo had become so strong that it rendered Silla virtually defenseless. Therefore King Chin Hung, during the 37th year of his reign, called upon the strong patriotic youths throughout the country to come to the defense of their land. The Hwarang Do was then formed to train the youths in order to meet the national crisis.


This group of youths represented royalty, high honor, and the spirit of the warrior. They were not only trained in the art of Tae Kyon but were also well versed in the literary arts. They enjoyed poetry, music, and morality. They also traveled to the mountains and rivers to train the mind and the body. In 668 A.D. with the assistance of the youth of this Hwarang Do, General Kim Yu Sin unified the territories of Korea.


By the end of the Yi Dynasty (1393-1910), the trend of thought was away from the art of valor and leaned toward the development of the literary arts. The art of Tae Kyon could barely maintain its existence, having no chance to further its progress from the original type of foot techniques.


During the Japanese occupation, after the Yi Dynasty, the hand techniques were introduced from both Japan and China. The traditional art thus combined these with the foot techniques. Their new art took on many names: Tang Su, Kong Su, Karate, Kwon Pop, Tae Su, and others. After the liberation of Korea in 1945, there was a movement to unify these art forms under a single name. In 1955 a special board of masters, historians, and prominent leaders was formed to solve this problem.


In April of 1955, the name Taekwondo was unanimously selected as the new title for the unified martial art of Korea. It was chosen for two basic reasons; the name had close connection with the ancient name of Tae Kyon in both meaning and pronunciation, and it best visualized the combination of the foot and hand techniques introduced by the various countries of the orient.


Today, Taekwondo is practiced by people all over the modern world and was, on July 17, 1980, recognized as an Olympic sport for the 1988 Olympic games held in Seoul, Korea.
