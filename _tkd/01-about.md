TAE KWON DO is a Korean style martial art dating back to the 6th century A.D. Tae means to kick or smash with the foot; Kwon means to punch or strike with the fist; Do means the art or method of. Therefore, taekwondo is the Korean art of foot and hand fighting. 


Taekwondo was developed as a means of self-defense, as well as a way of life for the Korean people. Its practice has been passed on from Master to student down through the generations, in secret during the Japanese occupation of Korea, and then on to its present day form. Although many techniques have been changed or improved to conform to today's society, the same basic principles (tenets) once taught by the ancient masters are still being taught by the modern day taekwondo instructor. Those tenets are: COURTESY, INTEGRITY, PERSEVERANCE, SELF-CONTROL, and INDOMITABLE SPIRIT. 


Today, taekwondo is taught as a very effective means of self-defense, and stresses foot techniques over hand techniques. Its training combines the total conditioning of body and mind, and is unsurpassed in developing a physically and mentally fit individual. 


Great advances have been made in recent years in taekwondo training for those who are physically challenged. By developing whatever physical skills an individual has, taekwondo can build self-confidence, self-respect, and a sense of well-being in these special people. 


Taekwondo has grown to become the most popular style of martial arts throughout the world, particularly here in the United States where it was first introduced in the early 1960's. Originally it was referred to as "Korean Karate", since this Japanese term was more familiar to the American public. 


In addition to self defense training, some of the specific benefits enjoyed by taekwondo practitioners are weight loss and control; increased muscle tone and endurance; physical control, coordination, and balance; improved poise, self-confidence, self-discipline, and maturity; a heightened respect of self and others; relaxation and inner peace. 


Taekwondo is one of the newest sports to be admitted into the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Olympic competition. It was a participant sport in the 1987 Pan American Games held here in Indianapolis, and a demonstration sport in the 1988 Summer Olympic Games held in Seoul, Korea.
